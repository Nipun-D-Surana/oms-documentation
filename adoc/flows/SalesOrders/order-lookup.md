# Order Lookup: Streamlining In-Store Operations

In the world of omnichannel retail, managing online order inquiries in-store presents unique challenges, especially for retailers without access to Shopify POS. Store associates often struggle to address customer inquiries directly due to a lack of access to centralized order information. This dependence on Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) leads to delays, disrupts store operations, and diminishes the overall customer experience.

## The Solution: HotWax Commerce Order Lookup Feature

HotWax Commerce offers a comprehensive Order Lookup feature within its Fulfillment App, empowering store associates to independently access detailed order information on their store devices. This feature eliminates the reliance on CSRs, enabling seamless in-store operations and improving customer service.

With the Order Lookup feature, store associates can:
- Quickly retrieve order details, including status, product availability, and delivery timelines.
- Provide immediate, accurate updates to customers, ensuring a seamless shopping experience.
- Enhance operational efficiency by reducing disruptions and optimizing staff performance.
