## Sales Velocity Calculation

This proposal outlines the development of a BI report to assist store managers in making data-driven inventory transfer decisions. Leveraging sales velocity analysis across all products and facilities, the report will identify high-demand and low-demand locations. 

## Inventory Transfer Recommendation Creation

[Document Link](https://github.com/hotwax/oms-documentation/blob/94a76904f4ffd56f480a93f993a9bbf7a7fe300f/mephisto/Requirements/Transfer_Order_Flows/Transfer_Recom/Inven_Trans_Rec_Create.md) 

This solution optimizes inventory balance by identifying facilities with stock shortages and recommending transfers from facilities with surplus inventory. It evaluates feasibility based on minimum stock levels and sales velocity while calculating shipment value for financial insight.

## Create Corrolating Transfer in Shipment

This workflow outlines how Transfer Orders (TOs) are managed within HotWax OMS after recommendations are accepted. It covers the creation and acceptance of TOs, fulfillment with "OUT_TRANSFER" shipments, and the generation of "IN_TRANSFER" shipments.

## Reconcile with QOH

[Document Link](https://github.com/hotwax/oms-documentation/blob/94a76904f4ffd56f480a93f993a9bbf7a7fe300f/mephisto/Requirements/Transfer_Order_Flows/Net_Trans_Orders/Reconcil_With_QOH.md)

This flow focuses on calculating net changes in inventory quantity on hand (QOH) due to transfer orders (TOs) between facilities. It ensures inventory accuracy and tracks inventory flows by reconciling transfers effectively.

## Discrepancy Identification Between Transfers and QOH

[Document Link](https://github.com/hotwax/oms-documentation/blob/94a76904f4ffd56f480a93f993a9bbf7a7fe300f/mephisto/Requirements/Transfer_Order_Flows/Net_Trans_Orders/Discrep_ID_BW_Trans_QOH.md)

This flow aims to identify and report mismatches between shipment quantities and inventory quantity on hand (QOH) differences during transfer orders.

## Net Transfer Orders

This report calculates the net movement of products between facilities for Mephisto retail stores, determining the total net transfers by aggregating outgoing and incoming shipments.
